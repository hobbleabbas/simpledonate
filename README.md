## Simple Donate

Welcome to SimpleDonate. This project is an attempt to streamline charity, by providing an Airbnb-like display of various charitable causes. A user can download tax receipts, see transparent stats about what the charity does with teh money, and receive proof of donation, all in one place. 

Unfortunately, many donations are misappropriated and used to pay for luxury hotels and flights for staff and admin. This is an attempt to provide transparency to the industry. We're open source and would love to have you contribute.
